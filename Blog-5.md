Invariants

An invariant is a problem solving technique. Typically, we start with a combination of a's and b's and try to rearrange them into normal form, where they are organized into a's first, followed by b's. 

Invariants are:
    length
    number of a's
    number of b's
    number of a's + number of b's
    number of a's = number of b's

A function is an invariant for an ARS if:
a -> b => P(a) = P(b)
