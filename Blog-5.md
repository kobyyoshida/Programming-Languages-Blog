Invariants

An invariant is a value that remains the same throughout a computation. An invariant can be used as a problem solving technique. Typically, we start with a combination of a's and b's and try to rearrange them into normal form, where they are organized into a's first, followed by b's. 

Invariants can be:
    length of equation
    number of a's
    number of b's
    number of a's + number of b's
    number of a's = number of b's
    any function that returns the same value before and after computation

A function is an invariant for an ARS if:
a -> b => P(a) = P(b)
