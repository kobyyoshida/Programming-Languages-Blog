How do newcomers learn functional programming?

Newcomers learn functional programming by trying it and working with it. Watching videos and having articles as guidance is a good help, but newcomers will need to start practicing things.

Many things are different about Haskell than more popular programming languages. To begin, the syntax will be very different. We will also use .hs on the extensions of any file we want to run. 

Functional programming has many advantages over other programming languages. For starters, code is much more concise on more complex expressions. Every object is immutable, and every function takes in one input and returns one output. Recursion is also used very frequently.
