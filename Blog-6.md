Unison

What is it?

Unison is a programming language based on content-addressed code. This means we define function by a hash instead of by naming. Every function, variable and operator is represented by a hash, making it a very uniform programming language.

Benefits

No builds: Once we compile and a function is saved as a hash, it never has to be compiled again, we just refer to the hash.

Easy Renames
No dependency conflicts
Durable Storage: Basically, when you compile the hashes are saved into a database like data structure. Since they are saved efficiently, if we delete a code block, we can get it back based off the hash.
