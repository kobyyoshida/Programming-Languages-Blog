Python vs Haskell

My personal favorite programming language is Python because of its diversity and simplicity. To begin, Python uses a ton of imported packages that provide functions made by previous programmers to allow efficiency for common tasks to other programmers. Python is a great option for both beginners and experts because of its diverse options in style, packages, and outside resources/documentation. Python is quite different than Haskell in practice, however there are similarities and each has it's own benefits. 

One of the main differences between Python and Haskell is that Python is what we call an "interpretted" language, meaning there is no compiling necessary and instead most computers are able to process the code by default. Instead Haskell is a compiled language, and we have practiced a lot of compiler construction to allow Haskell to recognize inputs and pattern match to manually output a result. The main benefit to this is it allows us freedom of limitations from things like syntax and styling in Python to create our own outputs and often "trim" lots of code that is relatively static in its operation. In other words, we manually create inputs and outputs granting more freedom for abstract ideas.

Another large difference between Python and Haskell is the style. Haskell uses a lot of recursion, acronyms, and operators that are mostly memorized and reused often. In Haskell's styling, there are also different files to keep track of for compiling. This is much different from any interpretted language because compiling is not even a thought in the programmers mind since it is basically automatic. Furthermore, recursion is something frequent in Haskell that is almost never used in Python. In Python, most programmers would use a for/while loop to run code repeatedly, but in Haskell programmers use recursion to accomplish most tasks in general. Recursion allows the programmer to accomplish tasks 

Some similarities between Haskell and Python include strong typing, whitespace dependency, and . Strong typing means instances of a type cannot be cast to another type. Haskell is strict on objects being immutable once they are created, and Python has certain objects that can have a type of any. Whitespace dependency is where indents, spaces and extra lines change the way code is run. Haskell requires code to be on the appropriate level of indentation, the same as Python. Also in Haskell, certain new lines and indentation format can cause errors. In Python, indentation is critical for declaring functions, loops, and other build in methods.

I will conclude with an observation stating that Haskell is more for experienced programmers, while Python can be used by professionals, beginners, and all skill levels in between. Python is more diverse and has specific rules to live by, while Haskell allows us to have some freedom (while following syntactical rules) to return custom outputs and run more efficiently.
