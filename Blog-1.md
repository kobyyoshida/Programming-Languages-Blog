# Newcomers and Functional Programming

Newcomers learn functional programming by trying it and working with it. Watching videos and having articles as guidance is a good help, but newcomers will need to start practicing things.

To start, I am on windows. I downloaded Haskell off https://www.haskell.org/platform/.

Many things are different about Haskell than more popular programming languages. To begin, the syntax and the thought process is very different. Typically I use Python and C# to do my coding, where we rely on packages we import. In Haskell, we create most things manually and do not rely on any previous code.

The major stumbling blocks for learning Haskell is the recursion. Recursion can be confusing when it is supposed to be used on most steps. Writing in recursion teaches us to learn a new way to format functions. Recursion can be confusing for beginners because its repetitive and can run infinitely when not implemented correctly. Another obstacle for beginners to overcome is the error messages. Haskell's error messages provide very little support to figure out whats wrong. This language provides a platform with less boundries that opens for more possibilities, but also opens more room for confusion.

Functional programming has many advantages over other programming languages. For starters, code is much more concise on more complex expressions. Every object is immutable, and every function takes in inputs and returns one output. Recursion is also used very frequently.

The only extra projects I have worked on outside of class are watching examples on YouTube. Usually a narrator will take a problem and solve it in Haskell using recursion and list comprehension. This is good practice to look over different thought processes using the same language, often by a semi-professional. Some of the blog posts in this directory are the examples from these videos.
