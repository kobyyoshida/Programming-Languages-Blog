Common Applications Written in Haskell

I was surprised to hear that there are many common applications coded in Haskell. 

One example of this is Facebook's extension Sigma. Sigma is used to protect against spam and fraud by checking interaction on Facebook posts for suspicious activities. This program was originally written in FXL, Facebook's own programming language, and then refactored to use Haskell. This optimized the code to run 3x faster than it was previously in FXL. Haskell also offered other benefits such as running different elements of Sigma independently, preventing bugs from crashing the entire large-scale platform. In addition to this, Haskell also offered concurrency for fetching data from different sources. This is a large part about how Sigma runs faster in Haskell rather than FXL.

Another example of a common application coded in Haskell is Target's supply chain optimization. In this case, supply chain optimization means ensuring the customers efficiently find what they are looking for, while minimizing cost. In this scenario, Haskell allows for Target to 

Haskell is also being used for the tech giant AT&T. AT&T is used for Network Security to automate the processing of internet abuse complaints. Specifically, Haskell was chosen here for its efficiency as well.
