# Lambda Calculus 
Î»
Lambda Calculus can be described as a function that takes an input and returns an output of some separate function made up of the inputs. Lambda calculus is the basis for functional programming. With the lambda calculus concepts, we can break up the expressions into legible trees for the compiler.

In lambda calculus we have three constructs for its entirety: 

Abstraction: 

Application: Applying some function to its argument.

Variables: Immutable identifiers.

Also grouping with parenthesis.

Abstract syntax trees are a key element to Lambda Calculus. They break down the input piece by piece until we have a tree with each node containing a symbol of the original expression. A syntax tree is an efficient way for us to visualize how the input is being parsed.

Substitution is an algebraic concept that occurs often in lambda calculus.

LambdaNat is another important function that is used to allow natrual numbers in Lambda Calculus. To start, natural numbers are defined as zeros and successors. Successors are any positive number in this case.
