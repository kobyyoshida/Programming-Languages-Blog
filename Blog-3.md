Abstract Reduction Systems

An Abstract Reduction System (ARS) 

ARSs have two qualities in order to prove a normal form. ARSs are one-step computations, and is a fundamental feature for any computing. 

Confluence:

Whenever x reduces to y and z, then y and z are joinable.

If an ARS is confluent, we have an algorithm that decides whether two elements are equivalent.

Terminating:

There is no infinite chain a0 -> a1 -> ...

These ARSs terminate when all the a's are organized together on one side of the equation.

Example:

baab
